My name is Billie. I am a general studies major at Mizzou. My degree is useless but I'm just going to school because my dad is a professor here
and I don't want to be a complete failure. I have past experience with graphic design and have built a website in the past using HTML, CSS, and 
Bootstrap, but that was like six years ago. I recently picked up photography last winter. My work is only Instagram (@virginiaavemedia)
but I hope the website I build in this course can help showcase my work.
