        <p>Hello and welcome! This website serves as an overview of my work experience. Here you will get to know a little bit about me. I will give an overview of my education as well as a summary of my work experience. A reflection on my time at each position and what they taught me will also be included. I hope that this will give you some insight into who I am, and who I would be as an employee!</p>
